kmer-graph-construction
kmer-graph-construction is a tool designed to build a graph from k-mers extracted from a given DNA sequence. It constructs a De Bruijn graph or any similar graph, where the nodes represent the k-mers, and edges represent overlaps between them. This is useful in tasks such as genome assembly, sequence alignment, and bioinformatics analysis.

Functionality
Constructs a graph from k-mers by breaking down a DNA sequence into overlapping subsequences of length k.

Stores each k-mer as a node in the graph, and edges represent overlaps between adjacent k-mers.

Graph Structure
The graph is represented as a dictionary where each k-mer is a key, and its neighboring k-mers (those that overlap by k-1 bases) are stored in a list.

Example
Given a sequence like:

AAAT AATG ACCC ACGC ATAC ATCA ATGC

The tool will construct a graph representing these k-mers and their overlaps.

Installation
You can clone or download the repository and run the code directly, or integrate the functions into your bioinformatics pipelines.

How to Use
Input: Provide a DNA sequence and the length k for k-mers.

Process: The program will generate the k-mers from the sequence and build the graph.

Output: The resulting graph is a dictionary where keys are k-mers, and values are lists of neighboring k-mers.

Example Usage
def de_bruijn_graph(k, text):
    graph = {}

    for i in range(len(text) - k + 1):
        kmer = text[i:i + k - 1]
        next_kmer = text[i + 1:i + k]

        if kmer in graph:
            graph[kmer].append(next_kmer)
        else:
            graph[kmer] = [next_kmer]

    return graph

# Sample Input
k_value = 4
input_text = "AAATGACCCTGAC"

# Generate k-mer graph
result_graph = de_bruijn_graph(k_value, input_text)

# Print the result
for node, neighbors in result_graph.items():
    print(f"{node}: {' '.join(neighbors)}")
Expected Output
For an input sequence and a k-mer length of 4, the output will list each k-mer and its neighboring k-mers in the graph.
